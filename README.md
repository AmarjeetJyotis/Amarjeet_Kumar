Welcome to the official repository for our research paper on "Identifying Critical Genes for Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning Techniques." In this project, we explore the application of advanced machine learning methods to identify and prioritize critical genes associated with breast cancer. Our study aims to contribute to the understanding of the underlying genetic factors driving breast cancer progression and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets.

Key Features:

Dataset: We provide details about the breast cancer dataset used in our study, including its source, preprocessing steps, and characteristics.
Code: Our repository includes the codebase for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and result evaluation. We use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict and classify genes relevant to breast cancer.
Research Paper: The full research paper detailing our methodology, experimental setup, results, and discussions is included. It presents our findings on the identified critical genes and their potential implications in breast cancer development.
Visualizations: We provide visualizations of key results, such as feature importance plots, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves, to enhance the understanding of our model's performance.
Contributions: We welcome contributions from the community to further refine our approach, experiment with different algorithms, or explore additional datasets.
Installation Guide: We offer a comprehensive guide to help users set up the required environment and dependencies to replicate our experiments and analyses.
